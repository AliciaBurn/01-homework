             <p>   My name is Alicia Burn. For over 25 years I have held a managerial position in the customer service field but 
                 I always wanted something more satisfying. The decision was made to leap out of my comfort zone and change my career path. 
                 The challenge of web development led me to enroll in Trilogy's Coding Boot Camp at the University of Pennsylvania. 
                 My goal is to secure a position that will allow me to utilize my knowledge in a creative work environment.</p>
            <p>   There are many different hobbies that fill up my time. I "enjoy" taking longs walks around Sesame Place, waking up for 7:00 AM flag football games, and cleaning up toys on a daily
                 basis. I also "enjoy" attending comedy open mic nights (not participating just watching), lending money to a struggling artist, 
                 and sipping my favorite bartender's latest concoction. You might find these activities odd but this is the life of a mother of 
                 two boys, Nye, age 7, and Tre, age 25. When I do get time to myself I love to explore new places and catch a good movie.  
                 My claim to fame is that I watched all the 2019 Oscar nominated movies in every single category including a foreign film 
                 without subtitles.
